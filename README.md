A collection of personal laptop dotfiles. 

## The setup 

- Laptop: Dell XPS 13 9350
- Window manager: i3wm

## How is the repo updated?

I'm using a bare git repo technique to sync this repo with my dotfiles on the laptop. The method is explained here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
